# The Seat Waiter

This project is an application built in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), based on the [Wait and Eat](http://www.angularcourse.com/#/) app course, using the [Angular Seed](https://github.com/fredsa/appengine-angular-seed-python)
AngularJS app bootstrap library.

Once completed, the app will be a way which busy restaurants and cafes can notify people waiting for a table that their table is ready, via text message through [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

Using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as the backend, and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to connect the app librarys, this github repo is basically a training excercise used to push myself even further with AngularJS while learning new librarys and ways to do things on the webisphere.
